career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Total IT work experience: 16 years.
      
      My first big project was development of MES and WMS systems at a Samsung Electronics
      production factory in Kaluga region, Russia. It was done as several intranet websites
      with an active usage of barcode scanners, barcode printers and RFID equipment. It
      took a team of five developers 3 years to fully develop a MES, WMS and an intranet
      system for local staff.
      
      Then I've joined netPrint.ru as a senior developer and quickly became backend lead in
      charge of a MES system for printing workflow. My team successfully completed several
      tasks, such as: print optimization (minimizing waste, optimal image placement),
      refactoring a legacy multilanguage system into several major components within a
      single technology stack.
      
      Worked at Mail.Ru Group - one of the largest IT companies in Russia, in a food
      delivery project - Delivery Club. My responsibilities were: creating new and
      modifying existing microservices.
      
      Took a major part in a project involving refactoring a legacy CRM system for real
      estate companies in Switzerland - RealForce Solutions SA, into a modern stack
      application with advanced property search mechanisms and complete tests coverage.
